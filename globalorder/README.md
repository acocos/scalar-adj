## Code for running global ranking model

Usage:
```
cd src
./run_ordering_experiments.sh
```

The weight accuracy (before global ranking) for the individual intensity-scoring 
methods will be written to `data/weightacc`.

The overall ranking evaluation metrics for the individual intensity-scoring methods
will be written to `data/rankresults`.
