## Code for running IQAP experiments

Usage:
```
cd src
./run_iqap_experiments.sh
```
The original IQAP dataset and code can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/cgpotts/iqap/tree/master/ACL2010).

Before running this code, you can download the original dataset and results:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgpotts/iqap/master/ACL2010/indirect-answers.combined.imdb-predictions.csv ./data
```
You'll need that .csv file in order to run the experiments.
